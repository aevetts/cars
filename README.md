# cars
This is a data science learning project. I'm working on building an app that will let users check the price of a used car against a neural network to see how fair the price is.

Currently, the data comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guanhaopeng/uk-used-car-market/data

A clean version of the analysis corresponding to the blog post is contained in blog_1102.pynb.
